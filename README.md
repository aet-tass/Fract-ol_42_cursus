# Fract-ol_42_cursus
    
    Fractal is a type of mathematical shape that are infinitely complex. In essence, a Fractal is a pattern that repeats forever,
    and every part of the Fractal, regardless of how zoomed in, or zoomed out you are, it looks very similar to the whole image . 
    
    In this project , we aim to generate different fractals (Mandelbrot_set , Julia_set , Burning_ship_set ...) using some mathematicals
    iteratives as well as the minilibx library which is a small C library used for rendering graphics, primarily used by 42 students .
